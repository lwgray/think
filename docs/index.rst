Think: A Language for Learning Computational Thinking
=====================================================

Think is an educational programming language designed to teach computational thinking through explicit problem decomposition. It helps users break down complex problems into manageable parts while providing interactive feedback.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install think-lang

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   objective "Calculate student grades"

   task "Process Grades":
       step "Get scores":
           scores = [85, 92, 78]

       subtask "Calculate Average":
           total = sum(scores)
           return total / len(scores)

   run "Process Grades"

Features
--------

* Structured problem solving with objectives, tasks, subtasks, and steps
* Interactive execution with real-time feedback
* Built-in explanation mode for learning
* Jupyter notebook integration
* Python-inspired syntax with educational focus

Using Think in Jupyter Notebooks
--------------------------------

Think provides seamless integration with Jupyter notebooks through magic commands.

Loading the Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, load the Think extension:

.. code-block:: python

   %load_ext think.jupyter_magic

Basic Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``%%think`` cell magic to execute Think code:

.. code-block:: python

   %%think
   objective "Hello World"
   
   task "Greet":
       step "Print message":
           print("Hello from Think!")
   
   run "Greet"

Explain Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable explanation mode using the --explain flag:

.. code-block:: python

   %%think --explain
   objective "Calculate average"
   
   task "Process Numbers":
       step "Initialize data":
           numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       
       subtask "Calculate Mean":
           total = sum(numbers)
           return total / len(numbers)

        step "Print result":
            print("Mean:", calculate_mean(numbers))
   
   run "Process Numbers"

.. code-block:: python

    [PROGRAM] Calculate average
[TASK] Executing Process Numbers
  [STEP] Executing Initialize data
    [VARIABLE] Assigned [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to numbers
  [SUBTASK] Executing Calculate Mean
    [VARIABLE] Assigned 15 to total
  [STEP] Executing Print result
    [SUBTASK] Executing Calculate Mean
      [VARIABLE] Assigned 15 to total
    [OUTPUT] Mean: 3


Available Styles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose from different output styles:

* default: Standard bracketed format
* minimal: Clean, simple format
* detailed: With separators
* color: With ANSI colors
* markdown: Using Markdown-style headers
* educational: With emoji icons

Example with style:

.. code-block:: python

   %%think --explain --style educational
    objective "Calculate average"
   
   task "Process Numbers":
       step "Initialize data":
           numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       
       subtask "Calculate Mean":
           total = sum(numbers)
           return total / len(numbers)

        step "Print result":
            print("Mean:", calculate_mean(numbers))
   
   run "Process Numbers"

   ‚Ä¢ Calculate average
‚Ä¢ Executing Process Numbers
  ‚Ä¢ Executing Initialize data
    üìù Assigned [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to numbers
  ‚Ä¢ Executing Calculate Mean
    üìù Assigned 15 to total
  ‚Ä¢ Executing Print result
    ‚Ä¢ Executing Calculate Mean
      üìù Assigned 15 to total
    üì§ Output: Mean: 3


Magic Command Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* --explain: Enable explanation mode
* --style STYLE: Set output style
